# CCDS-DrrGenPelvicXray

Pelvic Bone Segmentation on DRR generated pelvic Xrays from CT image.

## Brief Description:

This project's primary work is generating Bone Segments of pelvic X-rays. As there is no such available open-source dataset we are aware of providing annotation for Pelvic Xrays, we needed to annotate our own dataset. CT images from the open-source CTPelvic1k1 dataset were used for the Digitally reconstructed radiograph (DRR) generation of the X-ray image. A group of 5 students then teamed up for Pelvic Xray bone annotation. Finally, a benchmarking on a subset of dataset was done using the widely used Convolutional Neural Network-based model (UNet).
